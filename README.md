# Segmantation-Analysis
I have two datasets that  indicates customers behaviour in purchase from a store:
First I used join function to get one table.
Second, I made some descriptive statistics to better understanding.
Third, I wanted to know who is the most purchaser based on the id number of loyality card.
Finally, I used RFM metrics to estimate the result.
